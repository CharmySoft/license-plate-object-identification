**License Plate Object Identification**
========================


Introduction
------------------------
This project aims to find (and isolate by masking) the **registration plate** in the image [Reg.jpg](Reg.jpg) using MATLAB. Algorithms will be demonstrated on this specific image but they are designed in a general way so they will work on similar images. All designs aim to be as automated as possible.

Development
------------------------
This project is divided and marked by weekly progress. [Weekly Progress Blogs](/blogs) are used to record the related research into an area of computer vision and implementation of an algorithm design in MATLAB.
