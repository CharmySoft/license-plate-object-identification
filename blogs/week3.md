**Enhanced**
========================
<sup>*This is a blog entry from [License Plate Object Identification Blogs](./README.md).*</sup>

This week, our registration plate image is enhanced. The previously thresholded image is further transformed so that it is better suited for the detection of the licence plate.

The aim for the enhancment process is to get clear black lines of the surrounding licence plate. We can then perform an edge detection algorithm to identify corners in the rectangular licence plate.
