**Contrast Streched**
========================
<sup>*This is a blog entry from [License Plate Object Identification Blogs](./README.md).*</sup>

The contrast stretching uses statistics three-sigma rule to bound to 99.73% of data.

Results:

| Original | Contrast Streched |
| :---: |:---:|
| ![Original](./img/week1-original.jpg) | ![Contrast Streched](./img/week1-contrast-streching.jpg) |
| ![Original Histgram](./img/week1-original-histgram.jpg) | ![Contrast Streched Histgram](./img/week1-contrast-streching-histgram.jpg) |

From the results we can see that there isn't a noticeable change in these two images before and after the contrast streching. But because this project aims to develop a general algorithm that would work on other similar images as well. Contrast stretching, or normalization, is neccessary to help make this program more automated.
